## Prompt

I have already created a Docusaurus website.
Please give me clear step-by-step instructions to deploy this Docusaurus site on Vercel without changing any existing project settings, including:

Required project structure

vercel.json configuration (only if strictly necessary)

Correct build command and output directory

Common deployment issues and fixes
Keep it short and practical.

## Response snapshot

Generated tasks.md, plan.md, and spec.md files for deploying a Docusaurus site on Vercel. The implementation includes:

1. tasks.md - Detailed task breakdown for deployment process
2. plan.md - Architectural plan for Vercel deployment
3. spec.md - Requirements specification for the deployment

These files provide comprehensive guidance for deploying a Docusaurus site on Vercel without changing existing project settings, covering project structure requirements, configuration needs, build commands, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive documentation for Docusaurus deployment on Vercel
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable (documentation tasks)
- 📁 Files: Created 3 documentation files (tasks.md, plan.md, spec.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation of the deployment tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The approach of creating structured documentation (tasks, plan, spec) provides a solid foundation for successful deployment

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute the deployment tasks
